There are various ways to setup Ruby and Rails on Windows, but the easiest and quickest way I found to do it was using the Rails bundler for windows found here:
[http://railsinstaller.org/en](http://railsinstaller.org/en)

If you then want to go further and install Jekyll, use the following:

    cd C:/Railsinstaller 
    gem install jekyll

That's it.
